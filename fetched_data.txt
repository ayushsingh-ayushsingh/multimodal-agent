Sukoon Lyrics - Arijit Singh, Salim Sulaiman, Bhoomi 2025
Dil Wohi Sukoon Dhoonde
Waisa Hi Qaraar Maange
Dil Wohi Sukoon Dhoonde
Waisa Hi Qaraar Maange
Jo Kudrat Ne Bikhere The
Bas Meri Raahon Mein
Aur Qismat Ne Sajaaye The
Meri Nigaahon Mein
Jaane Ab Kahaan Milega
Kahaan Chhupa Hoga
Mil Jaata Toh Rakh Leta Main
Apni Panahon Mein
Woh Sukoon Shayad Mujhse Hi Hai
MujhMe Hi Tha Aur Mujh Mein Hi Hai
Sukoon Sukoon Sukoon…
[Peaceful song!]
Sargam
Jhaank Loon Khud Mein Zara,
Sab Kuch Hai Andar Mere
Lehron Pe Milta Nahin,
Jo Gehre Samandar Mile
Mehsoos Hoga Mujhe,
Jab Khudko Pehchanunga
Dil Ke Andar Dekh Kar,
Apni Rooh Ko Jaanunga
Doobega Doobega
Doobega Toh Tar Jaayga
Har Zarra Mera
Varna Tadap Ke Hi Guzrega
Roz Marra Mera
Kya Maine Kabhi Kiya Hai
Thoda Ishq Bhi Khudse
Mil Jayega Fhir Jo Dhoondta Hun
Main Darbadar Kabse Woh Sukoon
Woh Sukoon Shayad Mujhse Hi Hai
MujhMein Hi Tha Aur MujhMein Hi Hai
Woh Sukoon Shayad Mujhse Hi Hai
MujhMein Hi Tha Aur MujhMein Hi Hai
Sukoon Sukoon Sukoon

Woh Sukoon Mujhse Hai
Mujh Mein Hai Sukun
Sargam
Sukoon Sukun Sukun…
